For locals, by locals.\\n\\nSign Up\\n\\nWhile some Colorado kids grow up on the ski slopes or climb fourteeners on their fourth birthdays, Scott Derrickson’s Centennial State childhood was marked by movies.\\n\\nGrowing up in Shaw Heights, an unincorporated community just outside of Westminster, in the 1970s, Derrickson and his family would attend matinee screenings at the Westminster mall multiplex, sometimes followed by double features at the drive-in. “There weren’t a lot of families doing that. That was the best thing about my family growing up. We were all movie lovers,” Derrickson says. “That’s where my real love of movies began, because I was exposed to all different kinds of films.”\\n\\n![Image 6]\\n\\n Planning trips for the year?

Since completing his graduate studies at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, Derrickson has directed a swath of Hollywood horror films (_The Exorcism of Emily Rose_, _Sinister_, _Deliver Us From Evil_, and _The Black Phone_), remade the sci-fi classic _The Day The Earth Stood Still_, and overseen the Marvel action blockbuster _Doctor Strange_.\\n\\nDerrickson’s new film, _The Gorge_, combines many of the elements of his prior works. The sci-fi action horror film stars Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy as two elite snipers who are assigned to guard either side of a cavernous and impenetrable gorge. The only problem? Neither of them knows what lurks within it.\\n\\n![Image 7: Two snipers dressed in all black]\\n\\nMiles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy in _The Gorge_, premiering on February 14, 2025, on Apple TV+. Photo courtesy of Apple TV+\\n\\nAhead of its February 14 release on Apple TV+, we spoke with Derrickson about _The Gorge_, making original movies in the current Hollywood landscape, and how being from Colorado has shaped his creativity.\\n\\n_Editor’s note: The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity._\\n\\n**5280: _Growing up in North Denver, did you make films as a youngster?_**\\n\\n**Scott Derrickson:** I was playing with Super Eight cameras when I was in middle school and high school. I was very interested in the medium. As an undergrad, I wasn’t very career-driven. I was very confused, as you’re supposed to be when you’re 19. I ended up studying philosophy and literature for five years. But by the end of that, I knew I wanted to go to film school.\\n\\n**_How has your childhood in Denver impacted and inspired your movies?_**\\n\\n I could talk about that all day. I love Colorado. I think about it all the time. I have very, very fond feelings for the city of Denver. I saw a lot of it growing up. My father drove me all over the city. I think the biggest impact that Colorado had on me was the weather, which is a big part of the movies that I make. I’ve been all over the world, and there’s no place that has more distinct seasons than Colorado—Denver, specifically. The crisp fall, the freezing winter, the lush spring, the hot summer. Part of my biological clock is always waiting for the weather to change. I live in Los Angeles, so it never happens. There’s something about Denver’s weather that makes you feel very alive. Even when I go back, it doesn’t matter what time of year, I feel that sense of aliveness in the presence of the weather in that city. The natural environment is gorgeous. You have the mountains to your west. It feels like they’re watching over you. That’s a wonderful thing to grow up with\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"Scott Derrickson\",\n  \"url\": \"https://grokipedia.com/page/Scott_Derrickson\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Scott Derrickson (born July 16, 1966) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer best known for his work in the horror genre, blending ...\",\n  \"context\": \"Scott Derrickson\\n=====\\n\\n[]\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n⌘K\\n\\nToggle theme Edits History\\n\\n[]\\n\\nToggle theme\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n⌘K\\n\\n[Home]\\n\\n[Scott Derrickson]\\n\\n*  [Scott Derrickson]\\n*  [Early life and education]\\n*  [Career]\\n*  [Personal life]\\n*  [Artistic style and themes]\\n*  [Filmography]\\n*  [References]\\n\\nFact-checked by Grok last week\\n\\nScott Derrickson\\n======\\n\\nScott Derrickson (born July 16, 1966) is an American [film director], [screenwriter], and [producer] best known for his work in the horror genre, blending [supernatural] elements with psychological depth in films such as _[The Exorcism of Emily Rose]_ (2005), _Sinister_ (2012), and _[The Black Phone]_ (2021), as well as directing the [Marvel Cinematic Universe] entry _[Doctor Strange]_ (2016).[1][2][3]Born in [Denver], [Colorado], Derrickson grew up in a working-class neighborhood and initially pursued studies in philosophy and literature before committing to filmmaking.[4][5] He earned a B.A. in humanities with an emphasis on literature and philosophy from [Biola University], a Christian institution, and later attended the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, earning an M.F.A. in film production.[6][7] His early career included writing and directing the [direct-to-video][horror film]_Hellraiser: Inferno_ (2000), marking his feature debut as a director.[8]Derrickson achieved breakthrough success with _The Exorcism of Emily Rose_, which he co-wrote and directed, earning praise for its fusion of courtroom drama and demonic possession themes inspired by real events; the film grossed over $144 million worldwide on a $20 million budget. He followed with the sci-fi remake _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ (2008) and the supernatural thriller _Deliver Us from Evil_ (2014), based on a true story of exorcisms.[2] In 2016, he helmed _[Doctor Strange]_ for [Marvel Studios], which became a global hit earning $677 million and earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. Derrickson departed as director of the sequel _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_ (2022) due to creative differences over the film's horror intensity, though he remained an [executive producer].[9] He returned to horror with _[The Black Phone]_ (2021), a collaboration with producer [Jordan Peele] that received critical acclaim and grossed $161 million. He followed this with the sci-fi thriller _The Gorge_ (2025) starring [Miles Teller] and [Anya Taylor-Joy], which premiered on Apple TV+ to mixed reviews, praised for its visuals and score by [Trent Reznor] and [Atticus Ross].[10] His most recent directorial effort as of November 2025 is the horror sequel _[The Black Phone 2]_ (2025), again produced by [Jordan Peele], which has achieved commercial success.[11] Derrickson's films often explore themes of [faith], [evil], and the [supernatural], reflecting his personal Christian beliefs and interest in [theology].[12]\\nEarly life and education\\n--------\\n\\n### Childhood and family background\\n\\nScott Derrickson was born on July 16, 1966, in [Denver], [Colorado].[13] He spent his early years in a working-class, blue-collar neighborhood in North [Denver], an area marked by economic hardship and a diverse mix of Mexican and white families that exposed him to varied cultural influences from a young age.[14] This environment, situated near the Rocky Flats nuclear plant, later informed his reflections on childhood, including references to the site's historical plutonium leaks creating a so-called \\\"cone of death\\\" over the region during the [1960s].[12]Derrickson's upbringing was shaped by personal challenges, including prevalent violence in the neighborhood—such as [bullying] and frequent fights—that instilled a profound sense of [fear] as the dominant [emotion] of his childhood.[15][16] His family home also experienced tensions, contributing to an atmosphere of instability during his formative years.[17] These experiences, combined with a sense of emotional void in early [adolescence], prompted a pivotal shift when he converted to [Christianity] during junior high school, joining a strict fundamentalist church shortly thereafter.[18][12]His family was initially non-religious, with no emphasis on [faith] in his early home life, though his parents later became church-going around the time of his own conversion.[14] This period of transition marked the beginning of deeper explorations into [philosophy and literature] that would influence his budding interest in [storytelling], drawing from both the gritty realities of his local surroundings and imaginative escapes through reading.[14] These early influences laid the groundwork for his later pursuits in formal education focused on humanistic studies.\\n### University studies\\n\\nScott Derrickson attended Biola University, a Christian liberal arts institution in La Mirada, California, where he pursued undergraduate studies in the late 1980s. He earned a B.A. in communication in 1989, followed by a B.A. in humanities in 1990, with emphases in philosophy, literature, film, and drama.[19][20] His time at Biola involved approximately five years of intensive engagement with philosophy and literature, which he later described as a profound \\\"crisis of faith\\\" that challenged his earlier fundamentalist perspectives and deepened his intellectual foundation.[7]As a student at this evangelical Christian college, Derrickson was exposed to theological studies alongside his liberal arts curriculum, which influenced his emerging views on the intersection of [faith], [art], and [storytelling].[21] This environment, rooted in Christian principles, provided a formative backdrop for exploring how religious themes could inform creative expression, though it also prompted personal reevaluation through classical texts and philosophical inquiry. In 2004, reflecting his ongoing connection to the institution, Derrickson returned to Biola as an adjunct instructor, teaching a course on the history of European cinema during the spring semester.[19]Following his under\"\n}\n**Web Page 3:**\n{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"Films written by Scott Derrickson - Letterboxd\",\n  \"url\": \"https://letterboxd.com/writer/scott-derrickson/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Scott Derrickson (born July 16, 1966) is an American filmmaker.

Derrickson graduated from Biola in 1989 with a B.A. in communication and in 1990 with a B.A. in humanities. His wife, Joyce (Ericsson), graduated from Biola in 1988 with a B.S. in nursing. They have a two-year-old son, Atticus, and live in Glendale, Calif. Derrickson taught a class at Biola in the spring of 2004 titled “The History of European Cinema.”\\n\\n**Why did you make this movie?**\\n\\nI was interested in trying to combine two familiar movie genres — courtroom drama and horror. To my knowledge those genres have never been put together in a hybrid film before. I also wanted to make a film that would entertain the audience, but also would leave them thinking about significant spiritual issues.\\n\\n**Would you describe the movie as a success? Has it accomplished what you hoped it would?**\\n\\nIt’s been an amazing success. To date, the movie is the highest grossing film of the fall season, and it was the least expensive film of the fall to make. It will end up grossing about $80 million and, given it’s cost of only 19 million, that’s a huge financial profit. And the movie has done exactly what I hoped it would do: entertain audiences and get them thinking and talking about things they may not otherwise think and talk about. The exit polls that the studios conduct, the reviews, and the Internet chatter about the film all indicate that the movie has struck a real chord with audiences and has resulted in a lot of good discussion.\\n\\n**Has it done as well as you expected in the box offices?**\\n\\nI think it surpassed everybody’s expectations. Nobody thought it would be this kind of breakout hit.\\n\\n**Do you think there is an antisupernatural bias in a segment of the church today? Specifically, is there skepticism among some Christians that demonic activity occurs today?**\\n\\nThere are certainly a lot of churches that shy away from any real acknowledgement of the supernatural, but there are also plenty that do acknowledge it. I certainly think that uncomfortable subjects like sin and Satan are becoming increasingly less common topics for preachers and teachers in American churches.\\n\\n**Do you believe Anneliese Michel (the real “Emily Rose”) was possessed?**\\n\\nI’m not entirely sure. Her case was so complicated, I don’t think there’s any easy way to look at it. The complexity of it and the way it refuses easy explanation was what made it a good basis for a movie.\\n\\n**Do you believe demon possession is possible today?**\\n\\nI do.\\n\\n**In general, have Christians been supportive of the movie?**\\n\\nThey’ve been quite supportive — much more so than I expected. I think Christians are opening up their minds in a very positive way with respect to the range of art and entertainment that they appreciate. It’s very encouraging to see.\\n\\n**Did anything about the response to the movie surprise you?**\\n\\nI was very surprised that a handful of critics wanted to politicize the film. It’s a decidedly non-political movie but, because it deals overtly with issues of faith and religion, some reviewers wanted to drag the film into the culture wars, which was ridiculous in my opinion. A.O. Scott from The New York Times went as far as to call it right-wing propaganda, which is funny because I’m quite left wing in my political bent.\\n\\n**Were you expecting the kind of reviews you got from the critics?**\\n\\nThe reviews were mixed — about half positive and half negative. I thought they would be more unanimously positive, but I think that most of the critics who didn’t like the film were reacting to its spiritual content. The movie is very fair and balanced and doesn’t propagate a Christian agenda, but because it dared to take issues of faith and spirituality seriously, some liberal critics saw it as one-sided.\\n\\n**How did Biola prepare you for your current work?**\\n\\nI learned how to think at Biola. I was exposed to a universe of ideas there, especially in my literature and philosophy classes. I think I got a better education at Biola than many of the Ivy League students I went to grad school with at USC. They weren’t taught to think critically; they were only taught to be open-minded. I, on the other hand, learned to be open-minded by critically considering the value of different ideas. Without those years at Biola, I would have a very different view of the world.\\n\\n**When you were a student at Biola, what were your career goals? Did you ever imagine you would be the director/writer of a blockbuster movie?**\\n\\nI knew then that I wanted to be a filmmaker and, though I was pretty sure I would become a director, I never knew if my films would be commercially successful. When I started writing Emily Rose, I thought I would have to get it made independently. To make a movie that breaks out commercially like this one is something you really can’t anticipate.\\n\\nShare:\\n--\\n\\n* []\\n* []\\n* []\\n\\nCategories:\\n-----\\n\\n* [2006 Winter]\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### Biola Magazine Staff\\n\\nMore Posts\\n----\\n\\n[![Image 6: Biola campus]]\\n\\n### [Editor’s Note: Created to Create]\\n\\nJason Newell—January 21, 2026\\n\\n[![Image 7: group of students in front of BIOLA signage]]\\n\\n### [President’s Perspective: The B \"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"Scott Derrickson - Author Search Results - Free Library of Philadelphia\",\n  \"url\": \"https://catalog.freelibrary.org/Author/Home?author=Derrickson%2C+Scott.\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Scott Derrickson.

Wood, Jr.was born in 1924 to a blue-collar family in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. They say his mother, Lillian, dressed him up like a girl throughout his early childhood until people started making comments about it. Wood grew up during the Golden Age of film. Talking pictures had just been perfected and his childhood was filled with films that have since come to be recognized as timeless, horror classics –**_Dracula_**,**_Frankenstein_**,**_The Wolf Man_**, etc. As he grew up, however, his favorite genre was the Western. He and his friends would recreate scenes in those movies in the dark of night. His friends grew out of these fantasies but Ed Wood never did. Some think he never grew up at all.\\n\\nOn his 11 th birthday Ed received his most precious gift, his first movie camera. His film teachers were the images that played across the screen at Poughkeepsie’s Bardavon theater. He paid for these classes with his job as an usher. When he left work every day he would gather his local cast in the back yard, script the stories and take his place behind the camera.\\n\\nSoon after Wood turned 17, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Immediately following his high school graduation he enlisted in the Marine Corps. Reportedly, he fought in some of the fiercest battles of the war. One battle left his leg riddled with machine gun bullets and his teeth knocked out in a hand-to-hand with a Japanese soldier. At war’s end, he had earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart and a number of other medals. While recovering from his wounds in a naval hospital, he began using a typewriter every day. His speed and ease with the typewriter would grow to be legendary. He was discharged from service in 1946 at the rank of corporal. Within a year he had found his way to Hollywood. Within two years of his arrival in tinsel town, Wood had written, produced, directed and performed in his first big failure, a stage play.\\n\\nEd Wood had an easy time proving his lack of talent and success at failure in Hollywood through several directorial attempts. His career “lows” culminated with**_Plan 9 from Outer Space_**in 1958, his career peak which came to be known as the worst movie of all time.  I’ll add that I saw _**Plan 9**_ in a film course many moons ago and had a blast watching it. Ok, the blast was due to the extreme “badness” of it but I was entertained nonetheless. It beat a drawn-out lecture, in any case.\\n\\n[![Image 2: plan-9-from-outer-space-ed-wood-poster]]\\n\\nAfter this peak, Ed Wood went into decline, directing soft and later hardcore pornography before his premature death in 1978 at the age of 53. At the end of his life Ed Wood was an alcoholic and had many different projects in the planning. As we know, Wood never tasted real success and attained far more fame after he died than he ever had during his life. But, I think he had a hell of a time making his movies – and that’s something.\\n\\n[![Image 3: EdWood43]]\\n\\n_**Ed Wood**_, 1994 – Tim Burton, Director\\n\\nCast: Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey Jones, Vincent D’Onofrio, Bill Murray, George ‘The Animal’ Steele, [full cast and crew]\\n\\nTAGLINES:[![Image 4: 1994_EDWOOD]]\\n\\n_**Movies were his passion. Women were his inspiration. Angora sweaters were his weakness.**_\\n\\n_**When it came to making bad movies, Ed Wood was the best.**_\\n\\nTim Burton presents the story of a man with dreams and aspirations that go well beyond his limitations. Illusion gone astray.\\n\\n_**“Visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else’s dreams?”**_\\n\\n[![Image 5: EdwardDWoodJr]]\\n\\nEdward D. Wood, Jr. would do anything to make a movie – from selling his wife to getting baptized. Tim Burton presents that outrageousness via a caricature, of sorts albeit, with passion and heart. Burton’s Ed Wood possesses an innocence that allows him to see the world, and his “art” in a rather unique way, a way that touches us, that’s oddly endearing.\\n\\nIt must have been a blast to direct a film about making bad films. The style with which Tim Burton directed _**Ed Wood**_ is very effective for several reasons and on many levels One is the “cartoonish” aspect of the entire piece. The way things are exaggerated to match the subject of the film himself – bad Hollywood movies and one particular man who made them. A straight, somber style wouldn’t have played so well with these characters or subject matter. Kudos must be extended to screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski for their script, a perfect vehicle for Tim Burton.\\n\\n**Truth vs. make-believe**\\n\\nAlso worthy of mention is the way _**Ed Wood**_ makes a point of blurring the lines between reality and make-believe, which is my favorite aspect of the film. Throughout we see art imitating life imitating art. I’ll touch upon a few examples of this in a bit but jumping to the end, a particular scene that comes to mind is the very last shot of the movie where the camera pans out from the Pantages Theater, up to the Hollywood sign and up to the sky where the character of Ed Wood appears as the credits begin to roll. To me this is telling in that it is as though Burton is saying this film was Wood’s accomplishment as well, as though he was giving him credit for a good film about himself – a final homage. Maybe I’m reading too much into it but I liked what I saw – Wood’s greatest achievement was his own story, not his work.\\n\\n[![Image 6: ED Wood 1]]\\n\\nAnother is the scene where Bela and Ed are watching the Halloween movie on \"\n}\n**Web Page 3:**\n{\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"ED WOOD | William G.

In 2024, the centennial of his birth was marked by retrospectives and events, including an American Cinematheque series; a new critical study, _Ed Wood: Made in Hollywood USA_ by Will Sloan, was published in 2025; and the screenwriters of the Burton film, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, announced a biopic about Bela Lugosi for Universal Pictures.[1][5][6][7]\\nEarly life\\n----\\n\\n### Childhood and family background\\n\\nEdward Davis Wood Jr. was born on October 10, 1924, in Poughkeepsie, New York, to parents Edward Davis Wood Sr. and Lillian (Phillips) Wood.[8] His father worked as a custodian and maintenance worker for the United States Post Office, a position that provided stability for the family, who resided at 35 Delano Street in Poughkeepsie.[9][10] The Woods were a middle-class family, with Lillian having previously worked as a jewelry buyer at a dime store, though her primary role shifted to homemaking after Ed's birth.[10] In November 2024, a historical marker was unveiled at the childhood home to honor Wood's legacy.[11]Family dynamics played a significant role in Wood's early development, particularly through his mother's influence. Lillian had hoped for a daughter and, disappointed by the birth of a son, reportedly dressed the young Ed in girls' clothing during his childhood, sometimes calling him \\\"Shirley\\\" in an effort to fulfill her aspirations; this practice began when he was a sickly [infant] and continued intermittently until around age four or five, possibly as a form of encouragement or even mild punishment during illnesses.[12][13] These early experiences with [cross-dressing], rooted in familial expectations rather than personal choice at the time, would later inform aspects of Wood's identity, though they were not explored in depth until adulthood.[12]As a child, Wood displayed a precocious fascination with the performing arts and popular [entertainment], collecting comic books and [pulp fiction] magazines featuring Westerns and horror stories, which fueled his imagination.[9] He organized backyard plays for neighborhood children and, for his twelfth birthday in 1936, received a [Kodak] Cine Special [movie camera], with which he captured his first footage of the [Hindenburg disaster] on May 6, 1937.[12][9] Wood also pur\"\n}\n**Web Page 5:**\n{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"The Tragic Real-Life Story Of Ed Wood - Grunge\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.grunge.com/335779/the-tragic-real-life-story-of-ed-wood/\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"Feb 17, 2021\",\n  \"snippet\": \"...

Wright]Feb. 17, 2021 1:24 pm EST\\n\\n![Image 4: Ed Wood with face lit up][YouTube]\\n\\nLong before [Tommy Wiseau] made his reputation as the supreme purveyor of [bad film] with his wonderfully inept 2003 movie, _The Room_, Edward D. Wood, Jr., was delighting fans of 1950s' Z-grade cinema with shoddy sets, ham-fisted dialogue, and dimestore special effects in such cult classics as _Bride of the Monster_.\\n\\nRecognized by film critics Michael and Harry Medved as [the worst director of all time] in their 1980 book,_The Golden Turkey Awards_, Wood became a beloved cult figure thanks to his giddy enthusiasm for cinema and total lack of self-awareness. With the 80s TV revival of Wood's 1959 sci-fi horror film,_Plan 9 From Outer Space_, the long-forgotten director became a household name.\\n\\nBooks, documentaries, and magazine articles followed. By 1994, Wood-mania reached a crescendo with the release of Tim Burton's biopic,[_Ed Wood_]. Starring [Johnny Depp] and Sarah Jessica Parker, _Ed Wood_ was a funny and sometimes touching look at the life of a Hollywood outsider. However, Depp's goofy and endearing portrayal of Wood captured only a small part of the notoriously bad filmmaker's life. In reality, Wood's seemingly happy-go-lucky life as a wannabe Orson Welles was tinged with tragedy, alcoholism, and mental illness. Haunted by a lifetime of failure, Wood would turn to adult film in a last-ditch effort to stay in the industry he loved. [In 1978], he died destitute and largely unknown at the age of 54. This is the tragic real-life story of Edward D. Wood, Jr.\\n\\nEd Wood's childhood\\n-------\\n\\n![Image 5: Ed Wood dressed as a woman][YouTube]\\n\\nAs detailed in Rudolph Grey's 1992 biography,[_Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr._]_,_ Ed Wood was born in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., on Oct. 10, 1924. The first son of postal worker Edward Davis Wood, Sr., and Lillian Wood, Ed was a bright, handsome child who loved movies and comic books. A voracious reader, he consumed pulp Westerns and horror stories. According to Ed's wife, Kathy O'Hara, the director also organized backyard plays with neighborhood kids. When Ed's father gave him a movie camera, the plays soon became films. Young Ed captured history when he filmed the Hindenburg traversing the skies over the Hudson River shortly before its crash. That piece of film would be a lifelong point of pride.\\n\\nIt was during Ed's early years that he developed his penchant for wearing the clothing of the opposite sex. As depicted in Tim Burton's film, Ed's crossdressing originated in his mother's desire for a daughter — a theory confirmed by _Plan 9_ actress Mona McKinnon. \\\"He thought his mother wanted a girl ... instead of a boy,\\\" McKinnon said. Ed allegedly told his wife, Kathy, that his mother had dressed him as a girl until he was about 4 years-old. However, Ed confided to friend, author Scott Raye, that his mother's motivation was actually punitive. \\\"Ed said his mother was punishing him,\\\" Raye stated, adding that Ed told him, \\\"They didn't know what the hell they were doing to me.\\\"\\n\\nEd Wood in World War II\\n---------\\n\\n![Image 6: Ed Wood sitting at desk][YouTube]\\n\\nAccording to Rudolph Grey's [_Nightmare of Ecstasy_], Ed Wood enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1942. Wood, like many of his contemporaries, was spoiling to take the fight to the Japanese after Pearl Harbor. Just 17, Wood left his job as a theater usher to join with two of his friends. Wood, however, was the only member of the trio to actually enlist.\\n\\nMost bios of Wood state that the director saw combat at the battles of Guadalcanal and Tarawa, where he was awarded the Bronze Star, Silver Star, and the Purple Heart. Despite the intensity of the fighting in the Pacific Theater, Wood often joked that his greatest wartime fear was someone discovering he was [wearing a bra and panties] under his combat fatigues. Throughout his life, Wood claimed that his wartime experiences, which included being wounded by machine gun fire and having his teeth knocked out by a Japanese soldier's rifle butt, left him emotionally scarred.\\n\\nHowever, as detailed by Carl Sobicinski in his essay,[\\\"The Heroic Journey of Ed Wood,\\\"] much of Wood's wartime record is unverifiable and likely fabricated. The logistics of a Marine fighting at both Guadalcanal and Tarawa make Wood's participation in both battles highly unlikely. Although Wood's wife, Kathy O'Hara, claimed that the director's many medals including the Bronze Star and the Silver Star were lost in a move, there are no [official records]ocr.pdf?ver=b9CVtMVxAFzQD0M69a_Ccg%3d%3d) of a Cpl.

He defies comparison — there is no one remotely like him. Dispatched from time, his legend and reputation grows._“\\n\\n— Rudolph Grey, author of _Nightmare of Ecstasy — The Life & Art of Edward D. Wood Jr._, 1991.\\n\\nIn the world of cinema when you really think about it, they’re only two kinds of movies — good movies and bad movies. But what if I were to tell you that there is a third kind, and that is a so-bad-it’s-good movie — basically films that are so rubbish, but they are somehow really enjoyable. A recent example would be the 2003 “classic” from the 21st-century “disaster artist” himself, Tommy Wiseau’s _The Room_. It’s probably the most famous film in this niche sub genre, and is now infamous, especially in the Internet circles, but before Wiseau was even thought of, there was a Hollywood Legend, who set the gold standard for making movies that were so unspeakably bad they were somewhat, not just good, but legendary! Who was this man? Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the greatest “bad” movie director of all time, Edward D. Wood Jr. better known as just simply old Ed Wood!\\n\\nWhat can I say about “Eddie” — Director, Producer, Scriptwriter, Actor, Stuntman, Author, Journalist, Musician, War Hero, LGBTQ+ pioneer; he was a real “jack-of-all-trades”, but a master of one — making art that was debatably so bad, it wasn’t even good, but interestingly amazing! He had a catalogue of work that included motion pictures with “no budget”, special effects and scenery comparable to a primary school play, idiosyncratic stories, semi-coherent meme-worthy dialogue, mismatched stock footage, and an unhealthy obsession with Angora sweaters! Despite lacking in budget or talent, the qualities that kept Ed Wood going were his naive optimism, determination and his endless drive and ambition — he was no slouch when it came to his work ethic, contrary to what one may think!\\n\\nHe churned out a cottage industry of films, screenplays and novels of consistent quality (i.e. debatably minimal) lasting from 1948, until his unfortunate death in 1978, thanks to a heart attack brought on by chronic alcoholism. He is, of course, responsible for a certain sci-fi classic, which was, at one stage, said to be the worst movie of all time _Plan 9 From Outer Space_ (**SPOILER ALERT** — it’s not, and Plan 9 is not even his worst film!), which featured toy flying saucers on strings, not-so convincing aliens, a really unconvincing Bela Lugosi double and a endless book’s worth of quotable dialogue.\\n\\nWhile he remains a figure of fun in the world of cinema, Ed Wood’s life was actually very tragic, especially in his final decade, when he was reduced to directing “nudie cutie” flicks, that made the awful UK sex comedies from that time period look tasteful in comparison (good luck trying to sit through _The Love Feast_!) as well as tasteless erotic novels. At the end of his life, he was so broke, he couldn’t even afford to pay the rent. The more you learn about him, it really makes you wonder, should we REALLY be making fun of him? Then of course, there is Tim Burton’s excellent 1994 biopic on the guy, where Ed was portrayed to perfection by Johnny Depp. While not particularly factually accurate, it makes up for it’s lack of historical truth by being such a lovely celebratory tribute to a not-so-perfect man, as well as the late Martin Landau’s incredible performance as Bela Lugosi, for which he won an Oscar — even if Landau’s portrayal did swear like a sailor, which the real Lugosi didn’t really do in real life!\\n\\nEd Wood was also a man of contradictions, and he had a very oxymoronic personality; he was both pathetic and inspirational, and despite his conservative political views, he was decades ahead of his time when it came to trans issues, and also considering he could be a mean, violent drunkard, practically everybody who knew Wood had nothing but glowing things to say about the man (unless your Bela Lugosi’s son, Bela Lugosi Jr.). Despite being obscure in his time, he is now, ironically, one of the most famous filmmakers of the 1950s!\\n\\nOn a lighter note, as October 10th 2024 marks the great man’s 100th birthday (and also 2024 marks the 30th Anniversary of the 1994 Biopic), I thought it would be a great way to honour the cinema legend by writing a fun article about the greatest anti-hero that the movie industry has ever witnessed! I could write a whole book on the guy, but, to quote his late wife, Kathy Wood, Eddie was a notorious bullshitter! Plus, I would have to be a real masochist to sit through fading prints of 1970’s 8mm “Sex Education” short films that may or may not have been directed by Ed Wood. Before I go any further, I would like to give a shout-out to two very valuable sources of information, from where I sourced some of my research — Rudolph Grey’s fantastic, but very sad 1992 oral biography on the man (Nig\"\n}\n**Web Page 8:**\n{\n  \"id\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"Ed Wood | RiffTrax Wiki - Fandom\",\n  \"url\": \"https://rifftrax.fandom.com/wiki/Ed_Wood\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"Edward Davis \\\"Ed\\\" Wood, Jr. (October 10, 1924 — December 10, 1978) was an American screenwriter, director, producer, actor, author and film editor.\",\n  \"context\": \"Ed Wood | RiffTrax Wiki | Fandom\\n=====\\n[]\\n\\n[Sign In]\\n\\n[Register]\\n\\n[]\\n\\n[RiffTrax Wiki]\\n* Explore  \\n\\n  * [Main Page]\\n  * [All Pages]\\n  * [Community]\\n  * [Interactive Maps]\\n  * [Recent Blog Posts]\\n\\n* Wiki Content  \\n\\n  * Recently Changed Pages \\n\\n  * [RiffTrax Wiki]\\n  * [RiffTrax Live!]\\n  * [Samurai Cop]\\n  * [The Magic Christmas Tree]\\n  * [Fun in Balloonland]\\n  * [Santa Claus Conquers the Martians]\\n  * [Santa Claus (1959)])\\n\\n  * [Videos]\\n\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-0]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-1]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-2]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-3]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-1403144837]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-1403145396]\\n\\n  * [RiffTrax]\\n\\n  * [Mike Nelson]\\n  * [Kevin Murphy]\\n  * [Bill Corbett]\\n  * [List of RiffTrax]\\n  * [RiffTrax]\\n  * [The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 1]\\n  * [RiffTrax Live!]\\n\\n* [Community] \\n\\n  * [Recent blog posts]\\n  * [Forum]\\n\\n[]\\n\\n[Sign In]\\n\\n Don't have an account? \\n\\n[Register]\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[Sign In]\\n\\nMenu\\n\\nExplore\\n\\nMore History\\n\\n Advertisement  \\n\\n[Skip to content]\\n\\n[![Image 1: RiffTrax Wiki]]\\n\\n[RiffTrax Wiki]\\n\\n753\\n\\npages\\n\\n[]\\n\\n* Explore  \\n\\n  * [Main Page]\\n  * [All Pages]\\n  * [Community]\\n  * [Interactive Maps]\\n  * [Recent Blog Posts]\\n\\n* Wiki Content  \\n\\n  * Recently Changed Pages \\n\\n  * [RiffTrax Wiki]\\n  * [RiffTrax Live!]\\n  * [Samurai Cop]\\n  * [The Magic Christmas Tree]\\n  * [Fun in Balloonland]\\n  * [Santa Claus Conquers the Martians]\\n  * [Santa Claus (1959)])\\n\\n  * [Videos]\\n\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-0]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-1]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-2]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-3]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-1403144837]\\n  * [RiffTrax - Twilight Breaking Dawn pt 1 - Trailer!-1403145396]\\n\\n  * [RiffTrax]\\n\\n  * [Mike Nelson]\\n  * [Kevin Murphy]\\n  * [Bill Corbett]\\n  * [List of RiffTrax]\\n  * [RiffTrax]\\n  * [The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 1]\\n  * [RiffTrax Live!]\\n\\n* [Community] \\n\\n  * [Recent blog posts]\\n  * [Forum]\\n\\n[]\\n\\nin:[Ed Wood], [Plan 9 from Outer Space], [The Revenge of Doctor X], [The Bride and the Beast]\\n\\nEd Wood\\n===\\n\\n[][Sign in to edit]\\n\\n* [History]\\n* [Purge]\\n* [Talk (0)]\\n\\n**[![Image 2: Ed Wood photo]]**\\n**Edward Davis \\\"Ed\\\" Wood, Jr.** (October 10, 1924 — December 10, 1978) was an American screenwriter, director, producer, actor, author and film editor.\\n\\nIn the 1950s, Wood made a number of low-budget science fiction, horror and cowboy genre films, intercutting stock footage. In the 1960s and 1970s, he made sexploitation movies and wrote over 80 pulp crime, horror and sex novels. In 1980, he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award as Worst Director of All Time, renewing public interest in his work.
